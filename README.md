Project for CPSC 484: Intro to Human-Computer Interaction at Yale University

**TO RUN:**

1) Open `index.html` in a Chrome web browser window.
2) Add `?ip=172.29.41.16:8888` to the end of the URL (development phase)

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Our project is a study location finder that surveys users for their preferences and recommends their best fit option based on their answers to a variety of heuristics.

The problem space we are trying to address is that students have a difficult time finding a good study spot that suits their time/location/vibe needs. It is difficult to predict how crowded the space will be, what kind of seating there might be, whether it will be sufficiently quiet, and this is before taking into consideration amenities like bathrooms, private rooms, or if an id is required to access it.

The specific tasks we chose to address with our prototype are to choose a study location, to ensure access to amenitites, being able to gauge what each individual wants from a large spectrum of preferences, and finding locations that the user might not know about. We do this by setting up our quiz which evaluates the user's preferences to best match them to a spot and help them decide a location, as well as picking from a variety of locations both Yale affiliated and not. 

**CONSTRAINTS**

Our project takes input from the closest person to the screen, so the user must make sure that their kinect frame is the one closest to the sensor before using our program. There is also a maximum range, so it is recommended that they position themselves so that their head is near the center of the screen.
